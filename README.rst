Are you:

- Starting new projects by copying old ones?
- Wishing you could use someone else's project as a starter template?
- Confused at how to start "Project FooBar"?

I'm always starting a new project by cutting and pasting an old one. Skeleton
helps you get started with any project.  Uses `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_
and `py-configurator <https://github.com/ryankanno/py-configurator>`_.

basic usage
===========

.. code:: bash

    py-skeleton.py -s ./examples/ -d ./build -c examples/python.ini -e .tmpl

todo
====

- logging
- add other project templates I use
