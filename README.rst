py-skeleton
===========

Are you:

- Starting a new project by copying an old one?
- Wishing you could use someone else's project as a starter template?
- Confused at how to start Project FooBar?

I'm always starting a new project by cutting and pasting an old one. Skeleton
helps you get started with any project.  Uses `jinja2<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`
and `py-configurator<https://github.com/ryankanno/py-configurator>`.


basic usage
===========

`python py_skeleton/runner.py -s ./examples/ -d ./build -c examples/python.ini -e .tmpl`

todo
====

- logging
- add other project templates I use
